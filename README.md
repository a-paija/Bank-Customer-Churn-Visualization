# 📊 Banking Customer Churn Analysis in Tableau
***An Interactive Visualization Layer Built on Top of the [Python Modeling Project](https://github.com/a-paija/Why-Customers-Leave-MavenBank-A-Business-Analytics-Case-Study)***

This Tableau workbook is a direct continuation of the Python-based churn analysis and predictive modeling project completed earlier.
While the Python project handled data cleaning, feature engineering, predictive modeling (Random Forest), and risk segmentation, this Tableau version focuses on:
```
1. Turning the cleaned and enriched dataset into an interactive, executive-ready dashboard
2. Visualizing churn patterns across demographics, geography, engagement behavior, and credit score groups
3. Providing actionable insights directly from visual patterns
4. Creating a scalable, business-friendly interface for decision makers who prefer visual analytics over code
```

## 🎯 Business Objective

**Reduce customer churn by 25% within two quarters by identifying high-risk groups and enabling targeted retention strategies.**

Tableau makes this objective actionable through dynamic dashboards that reveal:
```
- Who is churning
- Where churn is concentrated
- Why customers are leaving
- Which segments require immediate intervention
```

## 📊 Top 5 Actionable Recommendations

| Recommendation | Key Insight | Action to Take |
|---------------|-------------|----------------|
| **1. Prioritize Retention in Germany** | Germany's churn rate is nearly **2× higher** than France. | Deploy localized retention campaigns, targeted outreach, and market-specific incentives. |
| **2. Increase Second-Product Adoption** | Single-product customers have an **83% churn rate**. | Launch cross-sell programs, guided onboarding, and personalized product recommendations. |
| **3. Implement Predictive Churn Scoring** | Current churn mitigation efforts are reactive. | Build a churn prediction model to identify at-risk customers early and drive proactive interventions. |
| **4. Introduce Product-Bundle Incentives** | Bundled customers show higher engagement and lower churn. | Offer customizable bundles and tiered benefits to deepen customer commitment. |
| **5. Deploy an Inactivity Alert System** | Customers often show declining activity before churning. | Set up automated inactivity alerts and personalized re-engagement workflows. |
